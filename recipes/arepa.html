    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The arepa is a food of pre-Columbian origin, made from ground dry
         <br>corn dough or precooked cornmeal, circular and flattened.
         <br>It is known under that name in Bolivia, Colombia and Venezuela,
         <br> and is traditionally consumed in the cuisines of these countries.​​​​</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>   
        <h4>For the Arepas</h4>  
            <ul>
                <li>300gr of water</li>
                <li>200 g. of precooked cornmeal of the brand that you like the most (in this case we have used the PAN brand)</li>
                <li>Optional: 3 g. of salt</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>for the filling</h4>
            <ul>
                Imagination and creativity, in addition to tastes, are fundamental. Cheese, ham, chicken, pork, avocado, scrambled eggs, onion and tomato, vegetables...        
            </ul>
    <h3>Arepas. How to make arepas, tips, advice and origin.</h3>   
        <p>Venezuela or Colombia? Panama or Peru? No, it is not a bet or a <br>
            soccer team match in the World Cup… We are looking for the origin of the arepas.<br>
             That which is more than a staple of a community; it is a symbol of identity.<br>
              Something like our potato omelette or calamari sandwich.</p> <br>
    <h3>Its origin. A little history about arepas</h3>
        <p>Although there has been a lot of controversy about where the arepas were born,
            <br>the truth is that we all know that they come from Latin America and that their
            <br> origin goes back further than 1539:</p>
        <p>«They make another kind of bread with corn like tortillas, about a finger thick,
            <br>round and big like a French plate, or more or less, and they put them to cook in a tortilla over the fire,
            <br>spreading it with fat so that they do not stick, turning them over until they are
            <br>cooked on both sides and this class is called areppas and some fecteguas.»</p>
        <p>This is the oldest reference to the arepa that we can find. Galeotto Cei wrote it in his “Voyage and description of the Indies (1539-1553)”.</p>
        <p>Thanks to this description, we can not only get an idea of ​​its age, as we said, but also know, quite precisely, what arepas are (fried, grilled or grilled cornbread cakes).
            <br>What Cei's explanation makes clear to us is that arepas originate from the Indies, as we already anticipated. From there, we only need to do a little research to discover that,
            <br>although they have become very popular in countries like Colombia, Peru or Panama, arepas come from Venezuela.</p>
    <h3>How to prepare arepas?</h3>  
        <h4>Mass</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    To make arepas we basically need two ingredients: precooked cornmeal and water.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Precooked cornmeal can be of different types. For the arepas we usually use P.A.N. You have white corn flour,
                    <br>an extra-soft white mix (white corn and rice), yellow corn,
                    <br>special corn for frying arepas (it is usually yellow) or the (most current) integral version.
                    <br>Choose the one you like the most, although I recommend white or yellow cornmeal.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        With them we will form our dough. It is very important that during the process we undo all<br>
                     the lumps of flour to obtain a smooth product.<br>
                     The dough should be elastic, but not sticky. Once our dough is obtained,<br>
                     we let it rest for a few minutes. After that time, we can tell if the dough is very dry if,<br>
                      when making the pancake, cracks form on the edges.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        In that case we must add water to the dough. If, on the other hand,<br>
                         the dough has become too soft and cannot be shaped easily, we must add a little flour.<br>
                          Once we get our dough to be perfect we will move on to the next step.<br>
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        <h4>The molding</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Shaping arepas is a fairly free process. The cakes are achieved by making balls<br>
                         with the dough and then flattening them to create a circular shape.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The thickness of the arepa varies depending on our tastes: they can be bigger<br>
                         and thinner or smaller and thicker.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        <h4>cooking</h4>
            <p>We can cook the dough for our arepas in different ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Fries:</h3>
                        <p>
                            It is usually the favorite option of most people. To make them like this,<br>
                         it is advisable to use a frying pan (preferably made of iron)<br>
                         and a sufficient amount of oil to cover up to half of the container.<br>
                          This ensures that the cooking is uniform and the arepas are golden brown in a few minutes. <br>
                        As a tip to know if they are done, tap them with your index finger. If the sound is hollow, they are ready to rest and fill.
                        </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Grilled:</h3>
                        <p>
                            It is a more complicated option than the previous one, and we must be much more careful so that they do not remain raw inside.<br>
                             We start with a very hot iron or frying pan that we will lower to medium temperature a minute after putting the first arepa.<br>
                              We must move them until they have the color and crunchy touch that we want.<br>
                             The process can take up to 15 minutes (it depends on the time we have), we should not be in a hurry.<br>
                        </p>
